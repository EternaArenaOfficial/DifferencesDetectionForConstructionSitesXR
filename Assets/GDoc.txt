📌 DifferencesDetectionForConstructionSitesXR
An XR application built with Unity for real-time comparison and progress tracking on construction sites. It detects discrepancies between on-site structures and reference BIM models using spatial mapping and Mixed Reality visualization.

🚀 Features
🔍 QR Code-based model loading using Microsoft’s QR Tracking package.

🧱 Reference model placement (pipes, installations, structures).

📊 Real-time spatial mapping and voxel-based difference detection.

📅 Week-based task segmentation with toggleable visibility and progress status.

✅ Progress tracking per model (e.g., Pipe1 50%, Pipe2 100%).

📝 CSV export of work progress for reporting and documentation.

🛠️ Built With
Unity 2021.x or later

Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) 2.8

Microsoft QR Code Tracking Package

C# (with Unity scripting API)

HoloLens 2 (or compatible Mixed Reality device)

🧠 How It Works
Scan a QR Code

Each QR code contains identifying text corresponding to a construction model (e.g., "PipeSetA").

Once scanned, the app places the associated reference mesh at the correct position in the physical world.

Load & Place Reference Models

Reference models can be individual elements (pipes, conduits) or full-scale sections of a construction site.

Placement is precise thanks to QR-based anchoring and spatial understanding.

Detect Differences

The app uses Unity's spatial mapping + a voxel comparison algorithm to detect differences between:

The reference model

The scanned real-world geometry

Differences (e.g., missing or misaligned installations) are visualized in the XR interface.

Track Progress

Construction elements are grouped by weekly progress milestones.

Users can toggle week groups ON/OFF and mark them as complete.

Completed elements turn green, indicating success.

Generate CSV Report

Upon exiting or on-demand, a .csv file is generated:

📦 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites:

Unity 2021.x or newer

Windows 10/11

Visual Studio 2019/2022 with UWP and XR packages

MRTK 2.8

Microsoft.MixedReality.QR NuGet package

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DifferencesDetectionForConstructionSitesXR.git
Open the project in Unity.

Configure MRTK:

Import MRTK Foundation and Examples via the Unity Package Manager or .unitypackages.

Set up the scene with MixedRealityToolkit and MixedRealityPlayspace.

Set build target to UWP, device: HoloLens 2.

Add Microsoft QR Tracking:

Import the Microsoft.MixedReality.QR NuGet package into your Visual Studio solution.

Deploy to device:

Build the UWP app from Unity.

Open the generated Visual Studio solution and deploy to HoloLens.

🎮 Usage Instructions
Start the app on HoloLens.

Scan a QR code near the construction site.

The app will:

Load the corresponding reference model.

Overlay it spatially on the scanned real-world scene.

Interact via gaze/gesture/voice to:

Toggle week-based model sections.

Mark parts as complete.

View visual difference detection.

Export progress via CSV.

📁 CSV Output Format
Each element being tracked is recorded in the output CSV file.

Name, Percentage, Status
Pipe1,50%, Non Complete
Pipe2,100%, Complete
Installation3,75%, In Progress
Name: ID or name of the construction element

Percentage: Detected completion based on voxel and mapping comparison

🔮 Future Improvements
 Add voice command support for marking sections as complete.

 Cloud sync of CSV reports.

 Multi-user collaboration on-site.

 Integration with project management tools (e.g., BIM 360, Procore).

 Real-time alerts for major discrepancies.
